# PCBBOARD_QUALITY_INSPECTION
This project aims to automatically detect defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using deep learning techniques â€” specifically the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection model. It provides a web-based interface where users can upload images of PCBs, and the system will analyze them to identify and classify any defects.
